### whither enums? 21/02/25

- include enums or not?
- tried a couple of ways and neither seem ideal
- maybe enums are just syntactic sugar for the m8 interface
- as no- one can remember the underlying ints
- but the sugar format is dictated by the constraints of the interface
- if you didn't have that, maybe the api would look different?
