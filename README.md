# Overview

A Python package for the parsing of Dirtywave M8 files

# Why?

Because whilst the M8 is amazing, it doesn't support every possible workflow use case

In particular I like to get started by generating lots of different variations of particular patterns, listening and seeing which ones I like, and iterating from there

This is a lot easier via scripting as opposed to copy/paste
