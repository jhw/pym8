# Overview

A Python package for the parsing of Dirtywave M8 files

# Why?

Whilst the M8 is amazing, it doesn't (and can't!) support every possible workflow 

I like to get started by generating lots of different variations of a particular base phrase + instrument combo, listening and seeing which ones work well, and then iterating from there

This is much simplified if you can script up said variations and not have to manually clone them all!

## Sunvox

I often think of Sunvox as a precursor to the M8 - single founder (@nightradio), tracker- based, great sounding engine

# Caveats

- [20/02/2025] song, chain, phrase, instrument [Macrosynth], modulators [ADSR, AHD] only
- [20/02/2025] M8 format v4.0.1 only
